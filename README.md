# cx16assem

File-based 65c02 assembler for Commander-X16

Work in progress.

Written in Prog8. (Requires prog8 compiler 6.2 or newer).

Compiling
---------

The assembler requires some autogenerated code for instruction matching.
This is created by a python script. You can do this manually and then use
the Prog8 compiler ``p8compile`` to finally compile the assembler, but
it's just easier to use the supplied Makefile:

Just type 'make'.

Type 'make emu' to immediately boot the assembler in the Commander X16 emulator.
