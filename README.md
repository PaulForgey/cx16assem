# cx16assem

File-based 65c02 assembler for Commander-X16 (Work in progress)

Software License: MIT open source. (see file LICENSE)

⚠️ **patched Kernal rom required**: This program requires [ZeroByte's patched Kernal](https://www.commanderx16.com/forum/index.php?/topic/2064-r39-patched-kernal-to-fix-load-into-hiram-functionality)
LOAD routine to deal with the HIMEM banks correctly!
Using the default unpatched V39 kernal Rom *will* crash the commander X16, and *can corrupt* your sd-card image! ⚠️

You'll need a recent prog8 compiler to build the assembler from source.

Also, due to remaining kernal / emulator bugs, *the file loading mechanism only
works on an attached sdcard image in the emulator*. Host mounted filesystem doesn't work.


## Compiling the assembler

The assembler requires some autogenerated code for instruction matching.
This code is created by a python script. You can do this manually and then use
the Prog8 compiler ``p8compile`` to finally compile the assembler, but
it's easier to use the supplied Makefile:

Just type 'make'.

Type 'make emu' to immediately boot the assembler in the Commander X16 emulator.


## Usage

*Note:* requires using a SD-card image to be mounted as drive 8 in the emulator, doesn't work currently on a host filesystem passthrough.

Usage should be self-explanatory: when started, the assembler prints the available commands.
After successfully assembling a source file, a summary will be printed. 
You can then enter the filename to save the program as on disk (will overwrite existing file with the same name!).
It's always saved in PRG format, so you can load the program again with ``LOAD "NAME",8,1``

## Features

- reads source files (any size) from disk  (sdcard)
- write resulting output directly as PRG file to disk (sdcard)
- can assemble to any system memory location 
- set program counter with ```* = $9000```
- numbers can be written in decimal ``12345``, hex ``$abcd``, binary ``%1010011``
- symbolic labels
- use ``<value`` and ``>value`` to get the lsb and msb of a value respectively
- define data with ``.byte  1,2,3,4``, ``.word $a004,$ffff`` and ``.str  "hello!"`` 
- can switch to (the rom-based) x16edit to edit a file, to avoid having to swap-load programs all the time
- disk device 8 and 9 selectable


## Todo

- more assembler directives?


### Maybe some day:
  
- include / incbin  to read in separate files

- simple expressions  (+, -, bitwise and/or/xor, bitwise shifts, maybe simple multiplication)

- local scoped labels and perhaps relative labels (+/-)

- macros

- better error descriptions?
