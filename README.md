# cx16assem

File-based 65c02 assembler for Commander-X16

Work in progress.

Written in Prog8. Requires prog8 compiler 6.0 and 64tass assembler.

Compiling
---------

The assembler requires some autogenerated code for instruction matching.
This is done via a python script. You can do this yourself and then use
the Prog8 compiler ``p8compile`` to finally compile the assembler, but
it's just easier to use the supplied Makefile.

Just type 'make'.

Type 'make emu' to immediately boot the assembler in the Commander X16 emulator.
