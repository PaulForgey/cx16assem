# cx16assem

File-based 65c02 assembler for Commander-X16

Work in progress.

Written in Prog8. (Requires prog8 compiler 6.2 or newer).

Compiling
---------

The assembler requires some autogenerated code for instruction matching.
This is created by a python script. You can do this manually and then use
the Prog8 compiler ``p8compile`` to finally compile the assembler, but
it's just easier to use the supplied Makefile:

Just type 'make'.

Type 'make emu' to immediately boot the assembler in the Commander X16 emulator.


Todo
----

- fix remaining addressing modes when using symbols

- optimize phase 1, it now does too many things double that are only needed in phase 2

- largest time saver now is to cache the source file in memory to avoid the need to reload it in phase 2.
  this is pretty hard to do unless the source file fits in memory.

- profile the various steps to see where the most time is spent i.e. what needs optimizing most 
  
- improve symbol table: more entries, faster symbol search


Maybe some day:

- relative labels (+ / -)
  
- simple expressions

- macros
